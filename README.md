Learning the hugging-face LLM course

This repository contains my experiments and adaptations based on the  
[Hugging Face Large Language Models Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/).

I have used the official course notebooks/materials and made modifications for learning, experimentation, or extension.  
All credit for the original material goes to Hugging Face.
